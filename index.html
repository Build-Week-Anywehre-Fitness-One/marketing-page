    <h2>We are Anywhere Fitness!</h2>
    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        Our application is designed to help YOU meet your fitness needs! Use the app to be able to find classes and instructors in your area! We accept applications for new instructors as well as having new members join every day! This application is meant for everyone, and you can also search for classes based on skill level and intensity. The opportunity to go to classes near you can also help you meet new people and give an opportunity for you to make new friends! Make sure you look at the skill and intensity ratings of a class so you know what you're going to be doing! Generally, the higher the intensity, the higher the skill level. Thank you for choosing Anywhere Fitness! Make sure to leave us feedback on how we can improve the application using our contact page. This also can be used for ideas of new modules we could add.
